Hi my name is Beatrice ( Bea ).  <br>
I have worked at art for many years, now I am playing.  The many hours that I spend drawing and painting have become a way of life for me.  Art is all around us, in nature and in our daily life.  I try to capture the natural beauty and the colors that seem to have no end.  Since the beginning of life, art has been created by even the smallest of life forms and the human form has probably managed to doodle in some artistic way right from its beginning.  These doodles and the art that evolved from them, along with the arts of nature, have always been in the same basic format and have been done with the same basic tools,,, until now!   Just think about what has happened with the advent of the Computer.  Have we, after all of the years that have passed, not found, ie created, a new medium for putting images to paper?  Are we the new kid on the block of the world of art?  Are we the pioneers of a whole new expression of the world we see around us?  I think we are, and it is exciting.  I have drawn and painted the pictures that I share with you on this media, which is such an appropriate place for such a new art tool/medium.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed playing.<br><b><b>     <p>
